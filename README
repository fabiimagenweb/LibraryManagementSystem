Library Management System in C#
Project Overview
This is a simple Library Management System built in C# as part of a guided learning process. It allows users to manage a small collection of books through a console interface.

Borrow Book: Borrow a book if available, with a limit of 3 books per user.

Return Book: Return a borrowed book and update its status.

List Books: Display all books in the collection with their current status.
